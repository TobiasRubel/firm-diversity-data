The code has dependencies of gensim, sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.

Run the code with python3 build_Model_pruned.py

Before running it, create a directory with each extracted 10-K as a file in the format:

['8744_0000798168_2001_JOULE-INC'\n
 " ITEM 1. BUSINESS General Joule I..."]

When opening the file with open(file).read(), the output should look like the example above.
This format is required for the t_n_d() function in build_Model_pruned.py to
parse the text properly.

The constants.py file should be updated accordingly. 
DATA_PATH_DIR should refer to the directory with the infividual 10-K files.
DATA_PATH_CSV should refer to the csv with 10-K title and product description as generated by th extraction code.
