The inclusion map has a column for each cik in the pruned dataset used for the paper, and a row for each year in the whole dataset (though we only use 1997-2017). 
A cell is 1 if it is both the case that the data exists in SRAF and in our training corpus, is 0.5 if the data exists in SRAF but not our training corpus, and is 0 if the entry doesn't appear in SRAF.
